# GIS for Friends of Princeton Open Space Riparian Restoration Project

## Overall goal

The primary purpose of the project is to facilitate the collection and
presentation of data for the NJDEP funded [Riparian Restoration Project](https://www.fopos.org/riparian-restoration-project),
with the stated aim to "rehabilitate riparian areas that protect lake
and stream banks from erosion, slow and store stormwater, and filter
pollutants from runoff."

**Note:** *QGIS* is a free and open source geographic information system (GIS). 
*QField* is a free and open source mobile app for data
collection that is integrated with QGIS.<br />

## Objective 1: Assist with Botanical Surveys

Assist with baseline plant and tree surveys in the area of Mountain
Lakes known as Riparian East

**Measurement:** Data on plants and trees for the project area is
collected in the field and the protocol is documented in Google Docs

**Timeline:** 6-13-24 until 8-31-24

**Tasks**

1. âœ… Review existing plant data protocol with the Stewardship Director

2. âœ… Assist with refining and mapping permanent transects within the project area

3. âœ… Assist with data collection in the field for the forestry inventory in July/August 2024

4. ðŸŸ§ Document the protocol in Google Drive in a way that can be easily adopted by future interns, community volunteers and/or school groups of various ages

<hr />

## Objective 2: Facilitate Botanical Data Analysis

**Measurement:** There is a pilot QField project for future data
collection with resulting data shared in Google Drive for evaluation

**Timeline:** 9-1-24 to ~~9-15-24~~ 9-30-24

**Tasks**

1. âœ… Create a map of the study area in QGIS (for printing as well as for use in QField)

2. âœ… Explore the creation of forms in QField for entering complex data using mobile devices

3. âœ… Manually enter the data collected thus far (on paper) into the QField form to test and refine its functionality; this will be iterative, getting feedback from the Stewardship Director and interns

4. âœ… Explore processes for efficiently getting data from QGIS into Google Drive (the flow: QField \> QGIS \> Google Sheets)

<hr />

## Objective 3: Present Data & Document Processes

This objective has two parts: 1. external: publishing summary data from
the baseline surveys and 2. internal: ensuring that the process is clear
and repeatable

**Measurement:** At least one map and project summary have been
publicized and internal Google docs outline how the process may be
replicated next season

**Timeline:** ~~9-15-24~~ 9-30-24 to 10-31-24

**Tasks**

1. âœ… With the Stewardship Director, identify and perform calculations to summarize and reveal patterns in data

2. âœ… Prepare one or more maps for publication (e.g. plant species distribution, tree species distribution) 

3. ðŸŸ§ Publish a project summary on the FOPOS site (and/or newsletter or social media), including tie-ins to the general effects of climate change and carbon storage data for the area of
   interest ðŸ”· adaptation: published here on GitHub
   
   | Project Summaries May Include |
	 | ---------- |
   | percent cover (plant abundance) |
   | status (native, invasive, introduced) |
   | weather |
   | highlights |
   | conservation concern |
   | conservation optimism |
   | species richness per species (no abundance) |
   | total hours |

4. ðŸŸ§ With the Stewardship Director, document ideas for continuity of the project with interns, students. or volunteers in a shared Google Doc

5. âœ… Ensure that all project documents and files have appropriate permissions (they are not locked down), that they are backed up, and that they are organized in a way that ensures the ongoing success of the project. calculate invasive native and conservation status

## How Climate Change is Included (for the [Forest Inventory](https://github.com/pmgreen/forest_inventory))

We aim to include carbon bank tracking based on the tree inventory, along with a general description of the effects of climate change
